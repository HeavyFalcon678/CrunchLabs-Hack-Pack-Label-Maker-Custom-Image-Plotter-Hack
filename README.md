# LabelMakerCustomImage
This is a hack of the CrunchLabs Hack Pack Box #3: Label Maker. It creates a custom Arduino code file that plots your chosen image. It can use .png, .jpg, and .jpeg formats.

**Instructions:**

  ‣ Install Python
  
  ‣ Install dependencies:
    
    • numpy
    • PIL
    • matplotlib

  ‣ Download main.py from this repository
  
  ‣ Open a terminal and run this command:
    python *pathtofile*/main.py *pathtoimage/imagefile.extension* *plotondark*
  
  *plotondark* is either 1 for plotting on dark, or 0 for plotting on light

  Then follow the instructions in the terminal and you will end up with the code file in your current directory. Upload that using CrunchLabs or Arduino IDE, and you're all set!
